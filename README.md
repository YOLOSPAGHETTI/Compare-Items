# Compare-Items

If  you're anything like me then you have an abundance of items and weapons and you're not sure if you need all of them or if any are objectively better or worse than others. If so, then this is the mod for you.

It will automatically compare any of your items that have the same power level, properties, and trait. It will let you know if any items are superior, inferior, duplicates, or similar to other items. Each item is labeled based on how it compares to similar items, which all share the same index.

Similar Items - Not objectively better or worse than one another but have the same power level, properties, and trait.

Key:
Index = i
Superior Items +i
Inferior Items -i
Duplicate Items =i
Similar Items ~i
